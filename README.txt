Hey Oliver, hope you had a great spring break.  If you're reading this you're in the right place.  To reiterate, my programming language is a preprocessor for Python called Hatch.  Be sure to check out the user guide in the documentation folder.  All source code including the .l and .y files are in the code folder.  Also, I've included some examples of Hatch in action in the examples folder.

Best,
