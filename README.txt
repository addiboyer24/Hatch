Hey Oliver, hope you had a nice spring break.  If you're reading this you're in the right place.  To reiterate, my programming language is a preprocessor for python called Hatch.  Be sure to check outthe users guide in the documentation folder.  All source code including the .l and .y are in the code folder.

Best,
